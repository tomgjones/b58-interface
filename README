# Introduction to "b58-interface"

b58-interface specifies interfaces for two programs related to 
Base58-encoding.  This is a family of encoding schemes used by Bitcoin,
as well as in various online services including URL shorteners
and photo web sites.

The program for encoding is [b58](html/b58.1.html).
The program for decoding is [b58-dec](html/b58-dec.1.html).

# Formats

The interface definitions are authored in mdoc format, which allows
semantic markup of interface elements such as options and other
command line arguments.  Files in this format can also
be displayed directly with the `man` program.

HTML versions are included in the `html` subdirectory.  These can be
regenerated by running `./configure && make html`.

# Installation and Packaging

As a convenience to packagers and end-users, the autotools build
system is used.  This allows the manpages to be installed to the
system's standard location using `./configure && make install`.
Automatic installation of the html versions is not currently supported.

# Change Control

## Versioning

Each released version of this interface has a unique version number.  Once
a version has been released, it will not be redefined.

## Backwards Compatibility

Reasonable efforts will be made to maintain backwards compatibility with
previous versions of the interface.  If a backwards-incompatible change
is made, a version will first be released containing a warning that
this aspect of the interface is subject to change, as a courtesy to
interface consumers.  This will be followed by a period of at least
one year before the incompatible version is released.  The major
version of the number will also be increased at this point.  In practice,
any improved redesigns of the interface which are backwards incompatible
in a way that could cause serious issues for interface consumers
are likely to be defined using a whole new set of names, thus leaving
b58-interface unaffected.

In this context we consider adding new interface elements to be a
backwards-compatible change, but changing the meaning of existing
elements to be backwards-incompatible.

Unreleased versions are not included when considering backwards
compatibility.

The intention is that it should be easy for implementors to include
all or part of the interface specification in their works, for example
bundling manpages with their implementations.
