<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B></B>


decodes its input from base58 and writes the result to standard output,
as a byte string by default.
If 
<I>B58STRING</I>

is given, the input is taken from that argument.  Otherwise the
input is taken from standard input, in which case it's allowed to
contain a single newline at the end.
<P>
The default base58 encoding is the Bitcoin encoding.  See
<A HREF="/cgi-bin/man/man2html?1+b58">b58</A>(1)


for a fuller discussion of the available encodings.
<P>
For output formats that are strings representing numbers (see -d
and -h), and if the Bitcoin encoding scheme is in use, then any leading
null bytes that would exist in the byte string are reported to
standard error in the form &quot;null bytes: N&quot;, followed by a newline,
where N is the number
of leading null bytes.  In this case, unless
<B></B>


fails, this will be the only line written to standard error.
<P>
Options are:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>-f</B>


<DD>
Flickr-style encoding.
<DT><B>-d , -decimal</B>


<DD>
Output the decoded value as a string representing a decimal number,
followed by a newline.  Leading zero bytes for the Bitcoin scheme
are represented as described
above.
<DT><B>-x , -hex</B>


<DD>
Output the decoded value as a string representing a hexadecimal number,
including a leading &quot;0x&quot;, followed by a newline.  Leading zero bytes 
for the Bitcoin scheme
are represented as described
above.

<H2>EXIT STATUS</H2>

Ex -std b58

<P>
A usage error, including providing any invalid data to decode, results
in an exit code of 64.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS</H2>

On most systems, argument lists are visible to other users.  So if
you're processing confidential data, feed
<B></B>


its input on its standard input, rather than in
<I>B58STRING</I>
